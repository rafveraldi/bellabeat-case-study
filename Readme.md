## Introduction

Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart
products for women. Considered a successful small company, they have the
potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.
Urška Sršen, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, believes that
analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth
opportunities for the company.<br/>
As a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team, I have
been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart
device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart
devices. The insights will then help guide marketing strategy for the
company.<br/>
In order to answer the key business questions of this study, I will
follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process,
analyze, share, and act**
