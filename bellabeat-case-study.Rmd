## Business Task

**Analyze non-Bellabeat smart device usage data in order to identify trends that will inform the company's marketing strategy.**

Key Stakeholders:

* **Urška Sršen:** Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer.
* **Sando Mur:** Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; Member of the executive team.
* **Bellabeat marketing analytics team**

The following questions will guide this analysis:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

## Data Source

As per Sršen's recommendation, a [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) will be used in this analysis. The data set is CC0 public domain made available through [Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic) via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), it contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users who consented to the submission of personal tracker data. It includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring as well as information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that will be used to explore users’ habits.

#### Data Assessment for credibility, reliability and integrity

The data set was downloaded and stored locally, it consists of 18 csv files in wide format. ROCCC data test model was used to determine credibility, reliability and integrity as follow:

* **Reliability:** The sample size (30 users) is too small to represent the full population of fitbit users. Therefore any statistical analysis, identification of trends and patterns have low reliability.

* **Originality:** Data is sourced from a survey by Amazon Mechanical Turk. As a third-party survey, this can be classified as low originality.

* **Comprehensiveness:** Data is within the parameters required for the Bellabeat’s business task.However, due to small sample sizing, unavailability of demographic data and incomplete data, the dataset has a low comprehensiveness.

* **Current:** Data was collected in 2016 and could not reflect the current population. Rated as not current.

* **Cited:** Data from survey was generated by Amazon Mechanical Turk, company within the Amazon group.

Overall, due to low credibility, reliability and integrity of this dataset, the following analysis can only be used as a first glimpse and direction. Any decision made from it should be verified by a larger analysis from a more reliable dataset.
